# Learn JavaScript Part 8

Time to sell cookies!

The functions in js.js need to be comleted to make
the app work.  

If working, then upon pressing the update button, a string
will be displayed such as: 

We have sold 200 cookies, and we are selling 53 cookies per hour, there are 4 hours left to sell 200 cookies. We don't need more people.

Clone or Fork the repository.  Fix the functions in the 
js.js file to make this work.  Something like live-server
can be used to serve up the app.  

If you have any questions, you can ask in the chatbox
on https://www.namelesshacker.com, or ask on the 
corresponding youtube video, or email me:

While this code may seem confusing to a beginner, your goal is to make it work.  Try to ignore complexity
and accomplish making the code work.  It's good to be in over your head, because you will always
be in over your head.
